# P1-Graphs
The first project, on Graphs, is an extension of the data structures and algorithms material in AP Comp Sci and will be coded in Java. Consider it a post-summer warmup! Graphs are an excellent way to represent and work with networks, such as computer networks, road networks, flight routes, printed circuit board connections, social networks, flow charts, etc...  We will explore various data representation strategies for a Graph object, as well as implement the classic graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. After implementing our Graph objects (as detailed in the GROspec), we will explore what these objects can tell us about some of the networks we are involved in. A secondary goal of this project is to explore design thinking, and the consequences of design choices.

 * GraphDataFileReader.java = a class that reads the data from the sample Graph files and returns an ArrayList of EdgePrototypes
 * EdgePrototype.java = a sample Edge class that is used to deliver the data from the sample Graph files
 * GDFRtester.java = an example of how to use the GraphDataFileReader class
 * Graph.java <- put your code in here!

Also included are some sample Graph files for your testing pleasure:
 * tinyG.txt  (small undirected graph)
 * tinyDG.txt (read this data assuming it is a directed graph)
 * tinyEWD.txt (small weighted graph)
 * tinyWG.txt (small weighted graph with non-numeric vertex names!)
